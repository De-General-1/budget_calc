About The app

Track all your income and expenses for a particular month or year. It shows you your total income, expense and available budget.

Input what income or expense you made in the input box and add the value gained or spent. Note that for expenses, put in the value as a negative number in order for it to be added to the expense list.

This website uses your localstorage and therefore even if you refresh the page, the data isn't lost until you delete it.

All the same, this is a simple web app but a useful one so use it and enjoy it.
